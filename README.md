# Scene Builder

Describe a scene in a high-level language (see [scene-lang](examples/scene-lang.md)) which can be compiled into BVH
format (for use with [SPIRV-Interpreter](https://github.com/mmoult/SPIRV-Interpreter)) or
[OBJ format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file) for easy visualization.
